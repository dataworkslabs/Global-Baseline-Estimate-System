# Introduction

This project is about building a movie recommendation system. Basically, if someone hasn't seen a movie yet, can we predict what rating they'd give it based on their past ratings? This is what Netflix does when it suggests shows to you.

I'm working with data from 16 critics who rated 6 different movies (Captain America, Deadpool, Frozen, Jungle Book, Pitch Perfect 2, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens). But not everyone rated every movie, there are gaps in the data.

My specific goal is to predict what rating Param would give Pitch Perfect 2, since he hasn't rated it yet.

I'm using something called Global Baseline Estimate, which is basically an algrothim used to estimate what a user will rate a certain film.

By the end I'll have a working R function that can predict any critic's rating for any movie, plus the specific answer to the assignment question: what Param would rate Pitch Perfect 2.

# Planned Approach

**Step 1: Load and explore the data**
I'll look at the dataset to see how many critics and movies there are, and check which ratings are missing.

**Step 2: Calculate overall average**
I'll add up all the ratings from all critics and divide by the total number of ratings to get the overall average.

**Step 3: Calculate user averages**
For each critic, I'll add up their ratings and divide by how many films they actually rated.

**Step 4: Calculate movie averages**
For each movie, I'll add up all the ratings it got and divide by how many critics rated it.

**Step 5: Handle missing data**
When a critic hasn't rated a movie, I'll mark it as NA (null), and use R code that automatically ignores these NA values when calculating averages.

# Anticipated Data Challenges

## Challenge 1: Missing Data

**The Problem**: Not every critic rated every movie. Some cells are blank or have "?" in them.

**Why it matters**: If I try to calculate an average and R thinks a blank cell is a zero, it'll mess up my calculations. Param's average would be wrong.

**How I'll handle it**: I'll convert all blanks and "?" to NA (R's way of saying missing data), and use `na.rm = TRUE` in my calculations so R ignores missing values instead of treating them as zeros.

## Challenge 2: Text vs Numbers

**The Problem**: When R loads the Excel file, it might read the ratings as text instead of numbers, especially if there are "?" symbols or spaces in the data.

**Why it matters**: You can't do math with text. If R thinks "4" is text, I can't calculate averages or add anything up. The whole algorithm breaks.

**How I'll handle it**: I'll convert all the rating data to numeric format using R code, so R knows to treat them as actual numbers that can be used in calculations.

## Challenge 3: Matching Names

**The Problem**: The function needs exact names to look up users and movies. If I type "param" instead of "Param" or "Pitch Perfect 2" with a space instead of "PitchPerfect2", R won't find it.

**Why it matters**: R is case-sensitive and doesn't ignore spaces. Even small differences mean R can't match the name, so the function will fail or return an error.

**How I'll handle it**: I'll check the exact column and row names in my data using colnames() and rownames(), then make sure to use those exact names when calling my function.

## Challenge 4: Users with Few Ratings

**The Problem**: Some critics like Nathan only rated one or two movies.

**Why it matters**: An average based on only 1 rating might not really represent how that person usually rates things.

**How I'll handle it**: For this assignment, I'll calculate the average regardless of how many ratings someone has, but I'll acknowledge this is a limitation. In a real system, you might require a minimum number of ratings before trusting someone's bias.

# Next Steps

Now that I've outlined my approach and identified potential challenges, I'm ready to start coding. I'll:

1.  Load the data and verify it looks correct
2.  Write R code to calculate the overall average, user biases, and movie biases
3.  Build the prediction function
4.  Test it with Param and Pitch Perfect 2
5.  Verify my results make sense

The expected result is that Param will rate Pitch Perfect 2 somewhere around 2-3 based on my hand calculations, since both Param and the movie have negative biases.
